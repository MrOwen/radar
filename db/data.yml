    - This is a report. It will be pretty long. There were probably some interesting
      things that happened. Amanda handled them very well I am sure. She is a great
      RA. I believe that she will be a great teacher as well. She is an education
      major. I like her a lot. But there were probably people disrepsecting her. Or
      maybe the students were compliant. I have not decided yet. I have not made the
      reported infraction table yet, so I have not chosen whose wrongdoing caused
      this report. Is this long enough yet? I hope it is getting to be long enough.
      I am not sure how many more thoughts are going to come through my fingers to
      this screen...

    - Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The
      story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of
      manners, upbringing, morality, education and marriage in the society of the
      landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five
      daughters of a country gentleman, living near the fictional town of Meryton
      in Hertfordshire, near London.Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th
      century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top
      of lists of most loved books such as The Big Read. It has become one of the
      most popular novels in English literature, and receives considerable attention
      from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number
      of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austens
      memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies
      worldwide.

    - ! 'The plot of the novel is driven by a particular situation of the Bennet family:
      The Longbourn estate where they reside is entailed to one of Mr Bennets collateral
      relatives - male only in this case - by the legal terms of fee tail. Having
      had no sons, this means that if Mr Bennet dies soon, his wife and five daughters
      will be left without home or income. Mrs Bennet worries about this predicament,
      and wishes to find husbands for her five daughters quickly. The father doesnt
      seem to be worried at all. The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy young
      gentleman and a very eligible bachelor, renting a country estate near the Bennets
      called Netherfield. He arrives accompanied by his fashionable sisters and his
      good friend, Mr Darcy. Attending the local assembly (dance) Bingley is well
      received in the community, while Darcy begins his acquaintance with smug condescension
      and proud distaste for all the country locals. After Darcys haughty rejection
      of her at the dance, Elizabeth resolves to match his coldness and pride, his
      prejudice against country people, with her own prideful anger - in biting wit
      and sometimes sarcastic remarks - directed towards him. (Elizabeths disposition
      leads her into prejudices regarding Darcy and others, such that she is unable
      to sketch their characters accurately. Soon, Bingley and Elizabeths older sister
      Jane begin to grow close. Elizabeths best friend, Charlotte, advises that Jane
      should show her affection to Bingley more openly, as he may not realise that
      she is indeed interested in him. Elizabeth flippantly dismisses the opinion
      - replying that Jane is shy and modest, and that if Bingley cant see how she
      feels, he is a simpleton - and she doesnt tell Jane of Charlottes warning. Later
      Elizabeth begins a friendship with Mr Wickham, a militia officer who is of long
      personal acquaintance with Darcy - they grew up together. Wickham tells her
      he has been seriously mistreated by the proud man; Elizabeth seizes on this
      news as further reason to dislike Darcy. Ironically, Darcy begins to find himself
      drawn to Elizabeth, unbeknownst to her.'

    - ! 'Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she
      is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield
      for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields
      and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss
      Bingley, Charles Bingleys sister. Miss Bingleys spite only increases when she
      notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.
      Mr Collins, the male relative who is to inherit Longbourn, makes an appearance
      and stays with the Bennets. Recently ordained a clergyman, he is employed as
      parish rector by the wealthy and patronising Lady Catherine de Bourgh of Kent.
      Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are amused by his self-important and pedantic behaviour.
      Though his stated reason for visiting is to reconcile with the Bennets, Collins
      soon confides to Mrs Bennet that he wishes to find a wife from among the Bennet
      sisters. He first offers to pursue Jane; however, Mrs Bennet mentions that her
      eldest daughter is soon likely to be engaged, and redirects his attentions to
      Elizabeth. At a ball given by Bingley at Netherfield, Elizabeth intends to deepen
      her acquaintance with Mr Wickham, who, however, fails to appear. She is asked
      to dance by Mr Darcy; here she raises Wickhams fate with him, causing their
      harmonious dance to fall into a testy discussion. The ball proceeds as spectacle:
      the arriviste Sir William Lucas shocks Darcy, alluding to Jane and Bingley and
      a certain desirable event; Mr. Collins behaves fatuously; now Mrs Bennet talks
      loudly and indiscreetly of her expectation of marriage between Jane and Bingley,
      and, in general, cousin Collins and the Bennet family - save Jane and Elizabeth
      - combine in a public display of poor manners and upbringing that clearly disgusts
      Darcy and embarrasses Elizabeth.'

    - The next morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him,
      much to her mothers distress. Collins handily recovers and, within three days,
      proposes to Elizabeths close friend, Charlotte Lucas, who immediately accepts.
      Once marriage arrangements are settled, Charlotte persuades Elizabeth to come
      for an extended visit to her new bridal home. Though appearing at the point
      of proposing marriage to Jane, Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns
      to London, leaving the lady confused and upset. Elizabeth is convinced that
      Darcy and Bingleys sister have conspired to separate Jane and Bingley. In the
      spring, Elizabeth joins Charlotte and her cousin in Kent. The parsonage is adjacent
      to Rosings Park - the grand manor of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr Darcys aunt
      - where Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to socialize. After Mr
      Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam arrive to visit Lady Catherine, Elizabeth
      renews her project of teasing Darcy - while his admiration for her grows in
      spite of his intentions otherwise. Now Elizabeth learns from Fitzwilliam that
      Darcy prides himself on having separated Bingley from Jane; and, with the poorest
      of timing, Darcy chooses this moment to admit his love for Elizabeth, and he
      proposes to her. Incensed by his high-handed and insulting manner, she abruptly
      refuses him. When he asks why - so uncivil her reply - Elizabeth confronts him
      with his sabotage of Jane and Bingleys budding relationship and with Wickhams
      account of Darcys mistreatment of him, among other complaints.

    - ! 'Deeply shaken by Elizabeths vehemence and accusations, Darcy writes her a
      letter which reveals the true history between Wickham and himself. Wickham had
      renounced his legacy - a clergymans living in Darcys patronage - for a cash
      payment; only to return after gambling away the money to again claim the position.
      After Darcy refused, Wickham attempted to elope with Darcys fifteen-year-old
      sister Georgiana, and thereby secure her part of the Darcy family fortune. He
      was found out and stopped only a day before the intended elopement. Regarding
      Bingley and Jane, Darcy justifies his interference: he had observed in Jane
      no reciprocal interest for Bingley; thus he aimed to separate them to protect
      his friend from heartache. In the letter Darcy admits his repugnance for the
      total want of propriety of her (Elizabeths) family, especially her mother and
      three younger sisters. After reading the letter, Elizabeth begins to question
      both her familys behaviour and Wickhams credibility. She also concludes: Wickham
      is not as trustworthy as his easy manners would indicate; that he had lied to
      her previously; and that her early impressions of Darcys character might not
      have been accurate. Soon, Elizabeth returns home.'

    - Some months later, during a northern tour, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle
      Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcys estate, while hes away. The elderly housekeeper
      has known Darcy since childhood, and presents a flattering and benevolent impression
      of his character to Elizabeth and the Gardiners. As they tour the grounds Darcy
      unexpectedly returns home. Though shocked - as is Elizabeth - he makes an obvious
      effort to be gracious and welcoming, and treats the Gardiners - whom before
      he would have dismissed as socially inferior - with remarkable politeness. Later
      he introduces Elizabeth to his sister, a high compliment to Elizabeth. Elizabeth
      is surprised and hopeful of a possible new beginning with Darcy.

    - Elizabeth and Darcys renewed acquaintance is cut short by news that Lydia, her
      youngest (and most frivolous) sister, has run away with Wickham. Initially,
      the family (wishfully) believe they have eloped, but they soon learn that Wickham
      has no plans to marry Lydia. Lydias antics threaten her family - especially
      the remaining Bennet sisters - with social ruin. Elizabeth and her aunt and
      uncle hurriedly leave for home; Elizabeth is anguished, and convinced that Darcy
      will avoid her from now on. Soon, thanks apparently to Elizabeths uncle, Lydia
      and Wickham are found and married. Afterwards, they visit Longbourn; while bragging
      to Elizabeth, Lydia discloses that Darcy was present at the wedding. Surprised,
      Elizabeth sends an inquiry to her aunt, from whom she learns that Darcy himself
      was responsible for both finding the couple and arranging their marriage, at
      great expense to himself.

    - Bingley returns to Longbourn and proposes marriage to Jane who immediately accepts.
      Now Lady Catherine surprisingly visits Longbourn. She sternly tells Elizabeth
      she has heard rumours of Darcy proposing to her; she came with determined resolution
      to confront Elizabeth and to demand that she never accept such a proposal because
      Darcy is supposed to marry her daughter. Elizabeth refuses to bow to Lady Catherines
      demands. Furious, Lady C charges off and tells Darcy of Elizabeths obstinacy
      - which convinces him that Elizabeths opinion of him may have changed. He now
      visits Longbourn, and once again proposes marriage. Elizabeth accepts, and the
      two become engaged.

    - ! 'The novels final chapters establish the futures of the characters: Elizabeth
      and Darcy settle at Pemberley, where Mr Bennet visits often; Mrs Bennet remains
      frivolous and silly - she often visits the new Mrs Bingley and talks of the
      new Mrs Darcy; Jane and Bingley eventually move to locate near the Darcys in
      Derbyshire. Elizabeth and Jane teach Kitty who had always been badly influenced
      by Lydia better social graces, and Mary who had been the most reclusive learns
      to mix more with the outside world at Meryton. Lydia and Wickham continue a
      life of frivolity which keeps them from accumulating any wealth and leads them
      to have to move often, leaving debts for Jane and Elizabeth to pay. At Pemberley,
      Elizabeth and Georgiana grow close; Georgiana is surprised by Elizabeths playful
      treatment of Darcy, and she grows more comfortable with her brother. Lady Catherine
      holds out, indignant and abusive, over her nephews marriage, but eventually
      Darcy is prevailed upon to reconcile with her sufficiently that she condescends
      to visit. Elizabeth and Darcy remain close to her Uncle and Aunt Gardiner -
      the agents of their reconciling and uniting.'
